# 🧠 Project Report: Gamified Learning App

---

## 🧩 Overview

**Project Name:** CodePlay – Gamified Learning & Quiz Platform
**Core Stack:** Svelte + FastAPI + PostgreSQL + Docker + OAuth (Azure AD B2C)

### 🎯 Purpose

CodePlay is a **gamified learning platform** that enables learners to:

* Solve interactive coding challenges
* Take quizzes and track progress
* Compete on leaderboards
* Unlock achievements and earn rewards

The app features a secure, modern UI (built with Svelte) and a robust backend (FastAPI, PostgreSQL) that supports scalable content delivery, progress tracking, and user authentication.

## 💼 Business Use Case

### Problem:

Traditional learning platforms often lack motivation and interaction. Students feel disengaged, and institutions struggle to track meaningful performance beyond grades.

### Solution:

**CodePlay** blends **gamification, self-paced learning**, and **admin-managed content** to create a **modern, engaging educational experience**.

Perfect for:

* **Educational institutions** (secondary, tertiary) that want a modular platform for learning to code or test theory knowledge
* **Language & tech educators** creating niche, competitive learning environments
* **Corporate L\&D teams** teaching tech skills with internal leaderboards

## 🏗️ System Architecture

```
[ Frontend (Svelte) ]
  |
  --> [ FastAPI Backend ]
           |
    +------+----------------------------+
    | PostgreSQL (User Data & Content) |
    | Azure AD B2C for OAuth Logins    |
    +----------------------------------+

* **Backend**: FastAPI REST API to manage users, quizzes, scores, and leaderboards
* **Database**: PostgreSQL for content, user progress, XP, and rankings
* **Auth**: OAuth2 via Azure AD B2C for flexible institution-level logins
* **Containerized**: Docker Compose for full local + production deployability

---

## 🚀 Implementation Roadmap

### 📍 Phase 1: MVP Setup

* Scaffold Svelte frontend with routing and OAuth login flow
* Set up FastAPI project with Docker
* Configure PostgreSQL models: users, quizzes, questions, submissions, XP
* Create basic UI for:

  * User login
  * List of quizzes
  * Taking a quiz and submitting answers
  * Viewing earned XP

### 🔨 Phase 2: Gamification Engine

* Add leveling logic: XP thresholds per level
* Assign badges based on milestones (e.g., “First 10 Quizzes”, “Perfect Streak”)
* Implement leaderboard logic with filters (weekly/monthly/all-time)
* Display user profile page with past performance, level, and badges

### 🧑‍🏫 Phase 3: Admin Portal

* Build separate Admin UI to:

  * Add/update/delete quizzes, questions, challenge levels
  * See statistics (most attempted, hardest quiz, average score, etc.)
* Role-based access control: distinguish admin and regular users

### 🧪 Phase 4: Testing & QA

* Perform UAT with sample users and institution staff
* Test edge cases (resubmissions, quiz scoring bugs, leaderboard updates)
* Add loading states, validation, and fallback messages

### 📈 Phase 5: Go-Live & Feedback

* Host with Render or Azure App Services + PostgreSQL
* Setup domain, TLS, and email notifications
* Monitor user activity and collect feedback
* Enable Google Analytics or Mixpanel for usage tracking
